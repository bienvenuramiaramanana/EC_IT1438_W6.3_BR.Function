  --Q4   Find the top 5 amounts between the "credit_card_transaction_flow" table and the "Repayment" table

	SELECT TOP 5 *
	FROM  ( 

	     SELECT [Transaction Amount] AS Amount

         FROM [Sympsons].[dbo].[credit_card_transaction_flow]
	   

		  UNION ALL

		  SELECT [Amount]
		  FROM [Sympsons].[dbo].[Repayment]

       )  AS Cordinate
		  ORDER BY Amount DESC

        ---Step 5 - Create a user-defined scalar function

		  CREATE FUNCTION  dbo.GetTop5TransactionAmounts()

         RETURNS TABLE
        AS
        RETURN
(
    SELECT TOP 5 [Transaction Amount] AS Amount
    FROM dbo.credit_card_transaction_flow

    UNION ALL

    SELECT TOP 5 Amount
    FROM dbo.Repayment

    ORDER BY Amount DESC
);
---Step 6 - Compare udf results to ad hoc query results

-- Step 1: Run the ad hoc query
SELECT TOP 5  [Transaction Amount]  AS Amount 
FROM dbo.credit_card_transaction_flow
UNION ALL
SELECT TOP 5 Amount
FROM dbo.Repayment
ORDER BY Amount DESC;

  -- Step 2: Execute the user-defined scalar function
SELECT * FROM dbo.GetTop5TransactionAmounts ();-- Step 1: Run the ad hoc query
SELECT TOP 5 [Transaction Amount] AS Amount
FROM dbo.credit_card_transaction_flow
UNION ALL
SELECT TOP 5 Amount
FROM dbo.Repayment
ORDER BY Amount DESC;

   -- Step 2: Execute the user-defined scalar function
SELECT * FROM dbo.GetTop5TransactionAmounts();

     --Step 7 - Perform a "0 results expected" test
     -- Perform a "0 results expected" test for finding the top 5 amounts

SELECT TOP 0 [Transaction Amount] AS Amount
FROM dbo.credit_card_transaction_flow
UNION ALL
SELECT TOP 0 Amount
FROM dbo.Repayment;

---Step 8- Ask the next question

--Q8 Could you identify the top 5 transaction amounts between the "credit_card_transaction_flow" table and the "Repayment" table separately for each table


-- Get the top 5  [Transaction Amount] from the credit_card_transaction_flow table
SELECT TOP 5 'credit_card_transaction_flow' AS c_BELOHA, [Transaction Amount] AS TransactionAmount
FROM dbo.credit_card_transaction_flow
ORDER BY [Transaction Amount] DESC;

 UNION ALL

-- Get the top 5 [Transaction Amount] from the Repayment tabl from the Repayment table

SELECT TOP 5 'Repayment' AS r_BELOHA, Amount AS TransactionAmount
FROM dbo.Repayment
ORDER BY Amount DESC;
